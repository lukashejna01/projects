# My Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Below you'll find a list of my projects.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Bank Account](https://github.com/lukashejna01/projects/tree/master/bank_app)
- This project implements a basic banking system with features such as account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry, using Python classes and JSON file storage.

### Project 2: [Fill contracts](https://github.com/lukashejna01/projects/tree/master/smlouvy_app)
- This project allows users to fill out contracts automatically by providing their personal information and selecting the contracts they want to generate (DPP or DPC). The filled contracts are then saved in a folder named after the user, where the newly generated files will be stored. Additionally, the script uses tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the docx library for handling Word documents, using Python.
